        <h2>Design Principles for HCI</h2>
        <p>This section covers the fundamental design principles that guide the development of user interfaces in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI).</p>
        
        <p>Fundamental design principles for Human-Computer interactions are guidelines that help generate user interfaces that are spontaneous, effective, and reachable. These doctrines emphasize understanding the users' wants and behaviors to ensure that technology provides both usable and enjoyable aspects. Main principles include consistency, which guarantees that similar responsibilities are performed in similar ways; feedback, where the system offers users flawless and fast responses to their actions; and simplicity, which involves reducing complexity to make interactions straightforward and easy to understand. Other important principles include user control and freedom, allowing users to undo actions and explore without fear of making irreversible mistakes, and error prevention, which designs systems to reduce the odds of user errors. Together, these principles target enhancing the overall user experience by making digital systems more responsive, engaging, and accessible to a wide range of users.</p>
