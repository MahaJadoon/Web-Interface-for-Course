            <strong>Specialized Input Devices: Eye-Tracking Technology</strong><br><br>
            Eye-tracking technology is a specialized input device in the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) that allows users to interact with computers and digital interfaces using their eye movements. This technology works by utilizing cameras and infrared light to detect the position and movement of the eyes, enabling the system to determine where the user is looking on the screen. Eye-tracking is particularly beneficial in accessibility contexts, providing individuals with physical disabilities an alternative way to control computers without the need for traditional input devices like keyboards or mice. In addition to accessibility, eye-tracking is used in fields such as gaming, where it enhances the immersive experience by allowing players to control the game environment with their gaze, and in research, where it provides valuable insights into user behavior and attention. By enabling more natural and intuitive interaction, eye-tracking technology exemplifies the advancements in HCI that aim to make digital systems more responsive and inclusive.
